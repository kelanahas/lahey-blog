        <h1>About Me!</h1>
        <p>Hey, my name is Lahey. I'm named after the character Jim Lahey from Trailer Park Boys!
           I am a Pembroke Welsh Corgi, and I'm devilishly cute...meaning I'm pretty spoiled rotten.</p>
        <h2>Daily schedule:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ate breakfast.</li>
            <li>Begged for some of my mom's breakfast...she conceded.</li>
            <li>Be a vacuum cleaner by grazing on fallen floor food.</li>
            <li>Went for a walk, get attention from strangers.</li>
            <li>Poop, then nap.</li>
            <li>Chase after confounded squirrels in the yard.</li>
        </ul>
